# Track-Your-Order

This project is a frontend-only demonstration of an e-commerce order tracking website. It allows users to enter an Order ID and view simulated order details and delivery status.  This project is designed for educational and demonstration purposes, showcasing a visually engaging and interactive user interface for order tracking without a backend database.
